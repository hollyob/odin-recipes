        <h1>Beautiful Butterfly Cupcakes</h1>
        <img src="https://bakeplaysmile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Butterfly-Cakes-5.jpg" alt="Three small cupcakes sit on a white surface. Their tops have been removed,
        and the space missing is filled with a cream-coloured buttercream. The tops hve been halved and sit on
        top to create wings. Each cake is lightly dusted with icing sugar.">

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><em>Butterfly cupcakes are quick and easy, and look sweet when they're finished - perfect
            for baking with children! I have many memories of making these with my Nanna when I was little.
            I loved how pretty the cakes looked at the end (and licking the bowl). We'd often split the mixture
            in two, adding cocoa powder to one half so that we'd have vanilla and chocolate to choose from.
            Feel free to experiment with whichever flavours and colours you like!</em></p>
        
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p>You will need...<p>

        </p><strong>For the cake:</strong><ul>
            <li>100g softened butter</li>
            <li>100g caster sugar</li>
            <li>100g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1sp baking powder</li>

        </ul></p>

        <p><strong>For the buttercream:</strong><ul>
            <li>175g softened butter</li>
            <li>350g icing sugar (extra for dusting)</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Place your cakecases into a cupcase tray and preheat your oven to <strong>180<sup>o</sup>C</strong></li>
            <li>Measure all of the cake ingredients into a bowl and beat well for <strong>2-3 minutes</strong>, until
            well-blended and smooth.</li>
            <li>Use a spoon to fill each case with mixture, being as equal as possible. <strong>Bake for 15-20 minutes</strong>
            , or until well-risen and golden brown. Allow to cool.</li>
            <li>While the cakes cool, make your buttercream. Put the butter and icing sugar into a bowl (with
                your desired colour and flavour - I love vanilla!) and beat until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Once your cakes are cool, cut the center out of each and slice in half. Fill each with buttercream (I tend
                to just use a spoon, but feel free to use a piping bag) and top with two halves - your
                butterfly wings!
            </li>
        </ol></p>
