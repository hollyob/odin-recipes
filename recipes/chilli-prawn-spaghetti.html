        <h1>Holly's Sublime Spaghetti</h1>
        <img src="https://khinskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/garlic-prawn-pasta-09.jpg" alt="A plate of spaghetti with large prawns. The dish is garnished with chilli flakes,

        edge of the plate.">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>This easy spaghetti has a real hint of flair and oozes romance - this is perfect for impressing guests, for
            pairing with wine on a summer evening, or for wooing your partner! This one is a little down to taste. Make it as
            spicy as you like by adding more or less of the chilli flakes.
        </em></p>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p>You will need...<ul>
            <li>Wholewheat spaghetti - save a small amount of pasta water after cooking!</li>
            <li>Peeled prawns (I use 150g to serve 2)</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Chilli flakes, to taste</li>
            <li>Juice of half a lemon, to taste</li>
            <li>Optional: a splash of white wine</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Prepare water for the pasta - add salt and bring to the boil. As the water heats up, chop your garlic and prepare
                other ingredients. Add olive oil to a large pan and turn on the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the garlic to the pan and allow to cook slightly <strong>on a low heat</strong> before adding the prawns. Allow
            them to cook a little before adding your chilli flakes. Keep your ingredients moving to avoid letting them burn!</li>
            <li>If the water is ready, begin cooking your pasta.</li>
            <li> While your pasta cooks, add some lemon juice to the pan. Leave a little, as you may want to add more once the pasta
                is cooked. <strong>If you're using wine, add a splash now!</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Drain your pasta once it has cooked, leaving a small amount of water behind. Add the cooked pasta to your
                other pan and stir, adding small amounts of the pasta water until you are satisfied with the consistency. Feel free
                to add more lemon or wine to taste. Serve immediately!
            </li>
        </ol></p>
