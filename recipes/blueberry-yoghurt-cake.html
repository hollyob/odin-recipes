            <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
            <p><ol>
                <li>Measure out and begin to melt the butter on a low-medium heat.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, place sugar, yoghurt, eggs, zest and vanilla extract into a bowl. Add the
                    melted butter and whisk to combine (don't overdo it!).</li>
                <li>Add the flour (using a sieve) and whisk until well-combined.</li>
                <li>Gently fold the blueberries into the mixture before transferring it into a lightly greased
                    loaf tin lined with greaseproof paper. Smooth the surface and <strong>bake for 1 hour</strong>
                    or until top is golden and a skewer comes out clean.
                </li>
                <li>Allow to <strong>cool for 10 minutes</strong> before removing the cake from the tin. Dust with
                icing sugar to serve.</li>
