        <p><h2>Description</h2></p><p>Be it Christmas, Easter or a gathering with no occassion, it is rare that my Nanna
        turns up to a family get together empty handed - and boy do our eyes light up when she whips out the recycled
        tub of Jacobs Cream Crackers. For inside that orange box often lie everyone's favourite snack; her sausage rolls.</p>
        <p>Now, these aren't any sausage rolls. They don't even try to rival the mighty Gregg's number (rather, they
        don't try and copy her) with their flakey pastry. Nanna's sausage rolls are a a buttery, shortcrust delight,
        crumbly and deliciously moreish. The same pastry recipe is used for her fruit-filled pies and savoury
        pasties - though you'd never think it, somehow. This diversity is the reason why I aim to master this recipe,
        and why I've shared it with you!
        </p>
        <p>You'll see that I've listed a few fats in the ingredients below - Nanna usually opts for a mixture of half
        TREX (a vegetable fat) and margarine, but I'd personally tend to stick with just butter (purely out of ease and
        perhaps the resaon that mine never tastes quite the same). Feel free to experiment and use whichever you prefer;
        either way, you'll end up with 4oz of fat in your mixture.
        </p>



        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <p> You will need...<ul>
            <li>8oz plain flour</li>
            <li>4oz butter OR 2oz margarine and 2oz TREX (vegetable fat)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>A little salt, to taste</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h2>Method</h2></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Crack your egg into a small bowl, add a little water and beat with a fork.</li>
            <li>Mix your chosen fat with the plain flour and a little salt. Make a well in the middle add
                pour in your egg mixture. Mix into a ball.
            </li>
            <li>Once in a ball, wrap your pastry in greaseproof paper (or clingfilm!) and pop it in the fridge
                for <strong>30 minutes.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Now you're ready to start rolling!</li>
        </ol></p>
