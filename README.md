My first HTML project; a basic, ugly site to be jazzed up in the future.

This project will contain an index page and links to other pages.

This is not designed to be pretty! Simply a way to solidify new html skills.

I will demonstrate the following:

Make lists
Make GOOD commit messages
Add links and images
Use basic syntax
