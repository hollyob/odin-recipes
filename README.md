# odin-recipes
My first HTML project; a basic, ugly site to be jazzed up in the future.

This project will contain an index page and links to other pages.

This is not designed to be pretty! Simply a way to solidify new html skills.

I will demonstrate the following:

- Make lists

- Make GOOD commit messages

- Add links and images

- Use basic syntax

TO DO:

- Add a 'Back'/'Go back' button to each recipe page
- Add a bg colour to the pages themselves
- Make a gap between the two bordered paragraphs (cos they UGLY rn - then again, will likely remove them later so no biggie)
